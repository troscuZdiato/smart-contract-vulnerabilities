REFlex 5.2.8 Win x64 is compatible with Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, as well as Fusion Studio and Nuke. It features a fast and intuitive interface that lets you control every aspect of your morphs and warps, from shape matching to edge blending. You can also use the built-in tracking tools to automatically align your images and create seamless transitions.
 
REFlex 5.2.8 Win x64 also supports GPU acceleration, which means you can render your effects faster and smoother than ever before. You can also export your morphs and warps as image sequences or movies, or use them as masks or displacement maps for other effects.

## Example 1: Morphing between two faces
 
One of the most common uses of REFlex is to morph between two faces. This can be done for artistic purposes, such as creating a hybrid character or a caricature, or for realistic purposes, such as changing the age or gender of a person.
 
To create a face morph with REFlex, you need to import two images of the faces you want to morph. You can use any image format that is supported by your host application. In this example, we will use After Effects as our host application.
 
Once you have imported your images, you need to apply the REFlex effect to one of them. You can find the effect under Effect > RE:Vision Effects > REFlex Warp. In the effect controls panel, you need to select the other image as the Source Layer. This will tell REFlex which image to morph to.
 
Next, you need to define the correspondence points between the two images. These are points that tell REFlex how to match the shapes and features of the faces. You can use the Add Point tool in the effect controls panel to create these points. You should create at least four points around the corners of each face, and then add more points around the eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and other details.
 
As you create the points, you will see a yellow line connecting them. This is called the spline curve. You can adjust the shape and position of this curve by dragging the points or using the handles. You can also add more points along the curve by double-clicking on it.
 
Once you have created enough points, you can preview your morph by scrubbing through the timeline. You can adjust the timing and speed of your morph by using keyframes on the Percent parameter in the effect controls panel. You can also use the Blend parameter to control how much of each image is visible in the morph.
 
If you are happy with your morph, you can render it as an image sequence or a movie file. You can also use it as a mask or a displacement map for other effects.
 
## Example 2: Warping an image with a grid
 
Another use of REFlex is to warp an image with a grid. This can be done for fun or for correcting perspective or distortion issues.
 
To warp an image with a grid, you need to import an image that you want to warp. You can use any image format that is supported by your host application. In this example, we will use Premiere Pro as our host application.
 
Once you have imported your image, you need to apply the REFlex effect to it. You can find the effect under Video Effects > RE:Vision Effects > REFlex Warp. In the effect controls panel, you need to select Grid Warp as the Warp Type. This will tell REFlex to use a grid instead of a spline curve.
 
Next, you need to adjust the size and shape of your grid. You can use the Grid Size parameters in the effect controls panel to change the number of rows and columns in your grid. You can also use the Grid Offset parameters to move your grid around.
 
Once you have set up your grid, you can start warping your image by dragging the grid points or using the handles. You can also add more points by double-clicking on a grid line.
 
As you warp your image, you will see a preview in your program monitor. You can adjust the quality and smoothness of your warp by using the Anti-Aliasing and Edge Blending parameters in the effect controls panel.
 
If you are happy with your warp, you can render it as an image sequence or a movie file. You can also use it as a mask or a displacement map for other effects.
